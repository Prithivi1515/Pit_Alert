SMART PIT ALERT WITH INTELLIGENT ALERT SYSTEM FOR OPEN BOREWELL AND DRAINAGE PITS

This project is a smart pit alert system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the water level in open borewells and drainage pits. The system sends alerts to the user when the water level is too high or too low, helping to prevent accidents and ensure safety.The system is designed to be easy to use and can be installed in various locations, including homes, farms, and construction sites. The project is built using Arduino and includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring and controlling the system.

## Features
- Ultrasonic sensor for water level detection
- Real-time monitoring of water levels
- Alerts for high and low water levels
- Web-based dashboard for easy access and control
- Easy installation and setup
